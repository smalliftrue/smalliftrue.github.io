        <h2>HOOSIERS STUN DUCKS AT AUTZEN</h2>
        <p>EUGENE - Prior to yesterday, the Indiana Hoosiers have never won a road game against a top-5 opponent. That streak is no longer, as Indiana (6-0, 2) beat Oregon (5-1, 19) 30-20. Mendoza threw a costly pick-six late in the game to let the Ducks tie it 20-20, but ultimately the Hoosiers prevailed, with quarterback Dante Moore of Oregon throwing two game-ending interceptions. The Hoosiers hope to stay undefeated and the Ducks hope to bounce back. Mendoza establishes himself as a clear front-runner for the Heisman trophy.</p>
        <h2>MATEER RETURNS, GETS DESTROYED BY HORNS</h2>
        <p>DALLAS - John Mateer's status with Oklahoma was in jeopardy as about two weeks ago he injured his thumb. His thumb is injured no more, as he came back into the game during the Red River Shootout on Saturday. However, two costly picks ensured that Oklahoma would never see the end-zone. Texas improves to 4-2 and Oklahoma falls to 5-1, with serious implications for both of these teams' playoff hopes.</p>
