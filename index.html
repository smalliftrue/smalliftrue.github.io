        <h2>NERDS WIN, NERDS WIN, AND NERDS WIN!</h2>
        <p>ATLANTA, COLUMBIA, BERKELEY - Georgia Tech (3-0, AP: NR, CVI: 16), Vanderbilt (3-0, AP: NR, CVI: 24), and Cal (3-0, AP: NR, CVI: 40) all recorded impressive wins over Clemson (1-2, AP: 12, CVI: 55), South Carolina (2-1, AP: 11, CVI: 64), and Minnesota (2-1, AP: NR, CVI: 57) today. GT's kicker Aidan Burr executed a flawless 55-yard career-long walk-off kick to seal the win for Jackets 24-21, and fans stormed the field and carried the goalposts into the President's mansion. Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia threw for 177 yards and 2 touchdowns in a statement win over the Gamecocks 31-7 on the road. Cal true freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele threw for 279 yards and 3 touchdowns as the Golden Bears start 3-0 for only the third time since 2007. All three teams are undefeated going into conference play.</p>
        <h2>REED, AGGIES WIN INSTANT CLASSIC IN SOUTH BEND</h2>
        <p>SOUTH BEND - Texas A&M (3-0, AP: 16, CVI: 3) beat Notre Dame (0-2, AP: 8, CVI: 26) for their first ranked away win in 11 years, 41-40 in South Bend. The Aggies started off slowly after a blocked punt turned into a touchdown for the Irish, and took their first lead near the half. After a botched extra point by Notre Dame, quarterback Marcel Reed drove the Aggies down the field, capping off a 293-yard performance with a game-winning touchdown pass on 4th and goal from the 12. Notre Dame, last year's runner-up, has yet to win a game this season, and Texas A&M is undefeated going into conference play.</p>

        <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
        <p>The computer votecasting index (CVI) has each team submit "votes" for the teams it played, based on how well a team performed in relation to their average opponent. Votes are then used to shift the scale until convergence is achieved.</p>
