        <h2>PENN STATE WHITED OUT AT WHITE OUT</h2>
        <p>HAPPY VALLEY - The Penn State Nittany Lions (3-1, 38) lost an overtime thriller to Oregon (5-0, 10) this weekend in Happy Valley. Despite an initially slow start which scored 3-3 at the half, both teams rallied their offenses and tied the game 17-17 late in the fourth quarter. A pair of touchdowns in OT1 brought the score to 24-all, and it seemed like the Lions would take it as they intercepted the two point conversion in the 2nd overtime. However, a pick by Drew Allar on the first play of the Lions' offensive drive ultimately lost the game, 30-24. Penn State head coach James Franklin falls to 4-21 against AP Top 5 opponents.</p>
        <h2>A PENALTY-RIDDEN A&M FIGHTS TO THE TOP</h2>
        <p>COLLEGE STATION - The field seemed buried in a layer of yellow flags as penalties on both sides combined for a total of 118 yards yesterday, in a defensively-dominated struggle between Texas A&M (4-0, 1) and Auburn (3-2, 32). Aggie QB Marcel Reed threw for 207 yards and 1 INT, but it was the A&M defense that won them the game 10-16, holding the Tigers to 0-13 on 3rd downs. Undefeated and #6 in the AP Poll, the Aggies hope to extend their first 4-0 start since 2016 when they face Mississippi State (4-1, 21) at home for their black-out game.</p>
